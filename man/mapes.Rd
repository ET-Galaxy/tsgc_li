\title{Compute Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for Forecasts Against
a Holdout Sample}
\usage{
mapes(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A \code{filterResults} or \code{filterResultsLI} object, obtained from
\code{estimate()} method.}

\item{n.ahead}{Integer specifying the number of days to forecast ahead.}

\item{Y}{An xts object containing the original cumulative dataset
with two columns: the leading indicator and the target variable.}
}
\value{
A list containing the MAPE values for both the trend forecast and
the forecast that includes the seasonal component.
}
\description{
This is a helper function that calculates the Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of a forecast generated by time series growth curve
(tsgc) models. It compares the forecasted values to a holdout sample,
providing a measure of forecast accuracy. If the vanilla growth curve model
is used, ensure that the date format is "\%Y-\%m-\%d".
